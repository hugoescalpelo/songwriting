# Grief in life

> _Updated 2023 10 30_

This song is about doing grief for people who are still alive.

Sometimes, family, friends and loved ones stop being part of your life. They change too much or they are the same person from too many years ago.

This song is inspired by family and friends that thinks they love you, but can't notice they despice you. For example, when they are very conservative and say very hurtful things to queer people or when they don't notice they don't love you unconditionally even when they say it, worsened by they not knowing how a healty relationship looks like.
